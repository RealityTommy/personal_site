					<p>I am currently a senior at Michigan State University, majoring in Experience Architecture (B.A.). With a long history in computer science, I enjoy applying those technological skills into my current engagements in education and the humanities.</p>
					
					<p>Alongside my studies, I also lead an organization at Michigan State University's College of Arts and Letters called the Innovation Team that works to apply new technologies into education in creative and innovative ways. With this position, as well as an educational trajectory in user experience and Black Studies, I hope to use the opportunity to gain more experience in community engagement and user-centered development.</p>
					
					<p>Through independent study, I take on projects that focuses on social networks/media, race relations in America, and humanistic design. In my latest project, I am working with MSU's College of Arts and Letters and Study Abroad Department to create a online network for students on study abroad to more easily document and share their experiences abroad.</p>
					
					<p>I am also an undergraduate researcher at WIDE Research Center, a digital humanities research group dedicated creating to new opportunities and new knowledge about digital communication, promote the transfer of discoveries, and help prepare a new generation of scholars and leader. Another extracurricular involvement is my membership with the United Nations Ambassadors Organization at MSU.</p>
