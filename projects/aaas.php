			<h2>African American and African Studies Program</h2>
			
			<p>Over the summer of 2014, the African American and African Studies Department at Michigan State University contracted me to take their existing website and rebuild it from the ground up to improve user experience, functionality and design.</p>
			
			<p>Using web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, I completed this project while focusing on a more user-friendly layout and responsive web design.</p>
