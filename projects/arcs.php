			<h2>Archaeological Resource Cataloging System</h2>
			
			<p>The Archaeological Resource Cataloging System (ARCS) is an open-source web platform that enables individuals to collaborate in creating and relating digitized primary evidence when conducting research in the humanities.</p>
			
			<p>For this project, I joined the MATRIX team at Michigan State University as a front-end developer to develop an existing CakePHP application into a new, modern design.</p>
