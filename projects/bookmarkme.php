			<h2>BookmarkMe</h2>
			
			<p>During the course of my Fall 2015 semester at Michigan State University, I gained more experience working with advanced web development tools and languages. For my final project, I decided to create a simple bookmarking tool that allows visitors to contribute their own favorite sites as well as view the favorites of others.</p>
			
			<p>While building this website, I was able to gain more skills with using MySQL, PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and APIs such as <a href="http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/">parallax.js</a> by MIT. One feature I am especially proud of is my first attempt at making a JavaScript bookmarklet, which can be demo-ed on the "Add" page of the website.</p>
