			<p>mbira is an open source platform for creating and managing location-based and mobile cultural heritage experiences.</p>
			<p>Currently in development at MATRIX: The Center for Digital Humanities and Social Sciences, mbira is a platform to build, serve, and manage native and web-based mobile heritage experiences. The goal of the project is to create a constellation of open source tools (existing and purpose built) that will lower the technical bar for individuals, projects, and institutions interested in building rich, engaging, and sustainable place-based and mobile heritage experiences.</p>
			<p>For this project, I joined the MATRIX team at Michigan State University as a front-end developer to develop mobile-first templates from the ground up for future cultural heritage projects.</p>
