			<h2>Experience Architecture Program</h2>
			
			<p>During the Fall Semester of 2014, I encountered the excellent opportunity to put together the first website for the Experience Architecture program at Michigan State University. My task was to take a modify an existing theme to conform with MSU branding standards and the branding of the program, populate it with the program's information and have everything ready for launch to present at an industry conference--all within one week.</p>
			<p>Using the Concrete5 content management system, I worked closely with the Experience Architecture faculty to build and shape the website into a living online space that not only appropriately advertises and inform its audiences while encompassing the ideologies of UX/UI.</p>
